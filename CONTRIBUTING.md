This is probably not the ideal means of communicating but here goes - I work at Sauce Labs and received a request
from one Ada Phillips <ada.phillips@mail.rit.edu> to create a free Sauce Labs Open Sauce account for this project.

`Moltimate is a tool used to predict the functions of enzymes. This is done by detecting structural homologies 
between the active sites of enzymes of unknown function and enzymes of known function. These homologies allow the tool 
to place the enzyme of unknown function into a family of enzymes of known function. Moltimate is being written for the 
RIT School of Chemistry and Materials Science as open source software. The application is written for use primarily by 
undergraduate students and their professors as a teaching tool.`

We would very much like to support the project but my reply to Ada bounced. Please reach out to bill.mcgee@saucelabs.com
for more information.
